            Missing: Joshua Swanson. Help us Find Him
            </h2>
            <br>
            Hello everyone,
            <br> <br>
            I am Beatrice Swanson, and I am writing here because I need help. I don‚Äôt know much about 
            the internet, but I am desperate and don‚Äôt know who else to turn to. My son, Joshua,
             disappeared years ago, and every day that passes without news of him is a day filled with pain.
            <br> <br>
            It was the night of December 24, 2012, a night that should have been happy, 
            filled with lights and laughter. But that night, my life changed forever. Joshua 
            was 40 years old at the time and was so excited about the holidays. But he never came home. 
            Joshua was a man dedicated to our community in Oregon. He worked as a box attendant, but his true 
            love was helping others. He was a volunteer firefighter, always willing to risk his life for others. 
            Also, he had a huge heart and would visit children's hospitals dressed as Santa Claus, bringing joy to children 
            who needed it most. He was always doing good things for others and touching the lives of those around him.
            <br> <br>
            I have done everything possible to find him: I have spoken with the police, put up posters, and 
            searched every corner of our town. But years have gone by, and I still have no answers.
             I feel so alone and lost without him.
            If anyone has seen Joshua or has any information, please do not hesitate to contact me. Any detail, 
            no matter how small, could be the key to finding him. If anyone knows how to help me spread this information, 
            I would greatly appreciate it. I don‚Äôt know how to 
            make this message reach more people, but I am willing to try anything.
            <br> <br>
            Thank you for taking the time to read this. My heart is broken, but I continue to hope that one day I 
            will receive news of my beloved son.
            With love and hope,
            <br>
            Beatrice Swanson<br> <br>

            P.S.: If any of you have gone through something similar, <br>
            I would love to hear your stories. I am not alone in this, <br>
            and any support is welcome.
